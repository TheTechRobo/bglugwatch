The Bruce Grey Linux Users Group (BGLUG) was founded in 2000 to bring local Linux users together and to help newcomers to Linux. The group
holds monthly meetings, gives technical presentations, distributes Linux CD-ROMs and hosts a web site, www.bglug.ca, which provides online support.

The Bruce-Grey Linux Users Group is currently centered in Owen Sound, but has members scattered around Bruce and Grey counties. The group is freely open to everyone.

Please see the support section and its sub topics for more information on the various services available.

We gather together for four main reasons:
- advocacy
- education
- support
- socializing

SHORT HISTORY

Bruce Grey Linux Users Group was originally founded by Richard Court in early 2000. Richard Court, Brad Rodriguez, Andrew Howlett and Dan Eriksen have been key members since its creation.

Richard has given up control of BGLUG to the current active maintainer, Dan Eriksen (site admin, LPIC-1 certified). A lot of work is still from the other members of the group, namely Andrew Howlett (meeting
 coordinator, LPIC-1 certified) who started our free CDs service.

Over the last few years we have seen the group grow significantly in size. Nearly everyone has played a role in making the meetings interesting and helping to keep the group going.

The bglug.ca domain was purchased in November 2002. After several months, the forums were added and then eventually our own mailing list.

We are constantly evolving and gladly welcome any constructive feedback and suggestions. If you have any thoughts about the group or the site, please let us know!

	Hi all:

	Earlier this week I received and email, ostensibly from 'Canada Post' claiming there was a missed package delivery, presumably at my home. It had the logos etc and it was addressed to me, pjr@bmts.com. But the tracking number in the email was blank.

	There was no record at the local post office of such a package nor was a 'door hanger' left on our front door to signify someone from CP had tried to deliver a package.

	The email included an attachment which, when I tried to open it, was gibberish - reminded me of a postscript file. It had a filename xxx.doc. The instructions at the top of the page said I should open it with MS Office as it was encrypted. I should have been suspicious immediately as there was no tracking number on the email. The alarm bells did not ring!

	As I do not have MS Office, I could not open the file.

	I got much more suspicious when I tried to forward it, to see if there was a package as the email also had others in the headers. The outgoing email was returned to me by the mail agent because

	"

	host mail.xxxxx.ca[149.248.52.47] said: 550-This message
	    contains a virus or other harmful content 550 (Doc.Dropper.Agent-7400026-0)
	    (in reply to end of DATA command)"

	In summary then, perhaps this was some kind of scam, a phishing attempt, or perhaps opening the attachment to 'decrypt' it would install a virus. MS Office does macros, doesn't it?

	For your information, as some would say.

	Peter

	Yes, that was certainly malware.  .doc files are a not-infrequent vector
	for attacks.  Many Windows users are vulnerable; I don't know if
	Linux OpenOffice tries to execute macros.

	In general, I'm suspicious of any unsolicited email that instructs me
	to "open the attached document" (or zip archive).  I've never had an
	email from UPS or FedEx or Canada Post or *any* legitimate sender come
	that way.  When I see such an email, I delete immediately.
