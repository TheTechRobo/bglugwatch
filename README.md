# What is BGLUG?
Bruce-Grey Linux User's Group is designed to help newcomers (and oldcomers) with Linux. We discuss things, give things away, and more!

# Are there pre-built binaries?
Go to the `dist` subdirectory for binaries. Currently there are only a few, but every bit helps!  
I used PyInstaller for building the binaries.
