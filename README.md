# BGLUGwatch development is suspended! 
BGLUGwatch has lately been feeling daunting.  
I have other projects that are much less daunting, therefore I am pausing development.  
If you would like development to be resumed, "star" this repository, and then I will start.  
(It might be before that, who knows?)
